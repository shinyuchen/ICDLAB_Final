# Functionality Introduction

## 1. MUX32 
    trivial

## 2. PC
    takes pc_i, checks if it is valid (no hazards and within the range), and output pc_o. 
    range: PC's maximum value = 32'd248 (if reached then stall).

## 3. Adder
    trivial

## 4. Instruction_Memory
    [spec] Composed of 64 32-bits memory elements
    the first instruction fragment = 1111_1110, and the last instruction fragment = 1111_1111, will be the indicators of CPU start and CPU end. (after CPU end, we stop writing instructions and start reading them)
    To write instructions, we must divide one 32-bit instruction into 4 8-bit instruction fragments due to I/O limitations.
    Address will be sent in the form of PC+4, and this module automatically transforms the address to array index.

## 5. ALU
    operations: SUM, AND, XOR, SUB, MUL, OR

## 6. shift2
    equals logical left shift by 1 bit

## 7. Sign Extend
    Simply equals MUX, but will extend 12-bit data into sign-extended 32-bit data

## 8. IF_ID
    hold three values: pc, inst, pcIm
    pcIm = the imm value of SB type instructions

## 9. Control
    op_i = opcode (last 7 bits in instructions)
    decided properties: 
    ALUOp    ,
    ALUSrc   , (second reg for ALU)
    RegWrite ,
    MemRd,
    MemWr,
    MemToReg,
    immSelect (Not sure about this one)

## 10. Registers
    RS, RT stand for two read registers, and RD stands for the write register.
    The purpose of is_pos_i remains vague, perhaps was designed for vector ALU?
    reg_o & op_address are for direct external accesses.

## 11. ID_EX

## 12. ALU_Control
    Simply control the ALU to take corresponding arithmetic through instruction identification.
    input: funct_i = {funct7, funct3} => Chances are not all bits are essential, might be simplified by logic simplification
    While adding more operations, the number of output controlling bits may also increase.
    n-bit ALU_op is generated by Main Controlling Unit and can decide op types (refer to textbooks for detailed implementation)

## 13. HazardDetect
    Consider to remove this part as it increases complexity and may be incompatible with newly added ops.

## 14. MUX_Control
    The MUX for Control which sits before ID_EX Flip-flops, trivial.

## 15. ForwardingUnit
    To deal with fixable hazards. i.e. passing register values in (EX_MEM | MEM_WB) stage back to ID_EX stage, where Forward_A(B) =
    00 => no hazard
    01 => MEM_WB to ID_EX
    10 => EX_MEM to ID_EX

## 16. ForwardingMUX
    The two MUX in front of ALU, decide whether the registers should be replaced with the Forwarded values

## 17. EX_MEM

## 18. DataMemory
    Give the address and Read/Write Memory.
    op_address & data_mem_o are for direct external accesses.

## 19. MEM_WB

## 20. VALU
    over = 1 is the indicator of overflow when negative value appears. 
    Remaining part is trivial

## 21. VALU_ctrl
    Similar to ALU_Control

# Self-defined Modules

## 1. Layer Registers (Including input, weight)
    Can we spare read/write address and I/O processing time? (as output of hidden layers are not necessarily important)
    If we can clearly constrain and point out where does the required sequence locate, we don't need to search them with read/write register address.
