**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-4313):	Innovus cannot determine the drive strength of clk_i, which drives the root of clock_tree clk_i.

Clock Tree Violations Report
============================

The clock tree has violations that CCOpt may not be able to correct due to the design settings.
A common cause is that the violation occurs in a part of the design (e.g. an ILM) that CCOpt cannot change.
Consider reviewing your design and relaunching CCOpt.


Max Fanout Violations
---------------------

Node the root driver for clock_tree clk_i at (195.900,1348.660), in power domain auto-default, which drives a net clk_i which is user don't touch, has 3319 fanout.



**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1361):	Routing configuration for top nets in clock tree clk_i: preferred layers metal3-metal4 are outside NanoRoute configured layer range. This is likely to cause routing correlation issues.
**WARN: (IMPCCOPT-1361):	Routing configuration for trunk nets in clock tree clk_i: preferred layers metal3-metal4 are outside NanoRoute configured layer range. This is likely to cause routing correlation issues.
